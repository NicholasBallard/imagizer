# Imagizer

This is an API offering a variety of image utility services.

Doing "stuff" with images is common for most computer users; daily for some; a make-or-break business problem for many organizations.

Imagizer comes into the "picture" (_badum tsss_) letting users perform image manipulation tasks without knowing a thing about the technical mishmash that goes into it.

From resizing an image, to running a picture through pretrained machine learning classifiers, Imagizer is here to capture the complexity and let users just get things done. 

## Features

### Resize image from a file

Upload a file, supply the downscale percentage, and returns the image in the request body.
### Resize image from URL

Resizes an image, but does not require sending the image data in the request body.

Instead, you supply the URL and the service will fetch the image from the web, then return a resized image.
