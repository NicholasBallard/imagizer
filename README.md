# Imagizer

This is an API offering a variety of image utility services.

Doing "stuff" with images is common for most computer users; daily for some; a make-or-break business problem for some organizations.

Imagizer comes into the "picture" (_badum tsss_) letting users perform image manipulation tasks without knowing a thing about the technical mishmash that goes into it.

From resizing an image, to running a picture through pretrained machine learning classifiers, Imagizer is here to capture the complexity and let users just get things done.
